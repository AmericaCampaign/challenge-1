## BSCA Challenge One

---

Make all the tests in shapes_spec.js pass
 - Your code to make these tests pass will live in shapes.js
 - use `jasmine-node .` to check if your tests are passing.

Use your constructor in arrayOfShapes to make a bunch of random shapes
 - You will use your newly made constructor to make a bunch of new shapes by looping through the arrays and applying your constructor to them.

User jQuery to append your newly made shapes to html.
